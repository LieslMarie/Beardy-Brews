# Beardy Brews

This is a code project about a fake brewery business model my husband and I came up with for his home brew "brewery".

My index.html page is an about page with some images I found online. The navigation is functional and links to the beers page and the contact page.
The text is just something I came up with and entered in repeatedly for filler content. I made my footer stick using Javascript code.

The beers.html is a slick image carousel featuring 6 different styles of beer with code pun captions.

The contact.html has an image with a contact form where you can input your personal contact information that has an alert pop-up upon completion.

To download my project, you can fork or clone the repo.

*Cheers*
